So first off I wasn't awarded service until I was in the restaurant for exactly 2 minutes and 34 seconds. Completely *OUTRAGEOUS!!! I then proceeded to order a Big Mac meal with the new grimace shake. I was disappointed to find that my Big Mac came with everything I asked and even came with the bun, but then things took a turn when I took a sip of the grimace shake and I turned into grimace himself I was *purple and *plump and *round, then brain rot entered my mind and has not left yet. To this day I lurk the streets of the USA looking for any other grimace companions to partner with in future adventures
